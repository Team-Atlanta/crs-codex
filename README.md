# atlantis-codex

A [CRS](https://github.com/oss-crs) (Cyber Reasoning System) that uses [Codex](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to autonomously find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source projects.

Given proof-of-vulnerability (POV) inputs that crash a target binary, the agent analyzes the crashes, edits source code, builds, tests, iterates, and submits a verified patch — all autonomously.

## How it works

```
POV files → reproduce crashes → Codex agent → .diff patch
                                       ↕
                                 libCRS (build & test via builder sidecar)
```

1. **`run_patcher`** scans for POV files (all present before container starts) and reproduces all crashes against the unpatched binary.
2. All POVs are batched as variants of the same vulnerability and handed to the **agent** (selected via `CRS_AGENT` env var) in a single session.
3. The agent autonomously analyzes the vulnerability, edits source, and uses **libCRS** tools to build and test patches through a builder sidecar container — verifying against all POV variants.
4. A verified `.diff` is written to `/patches/`, where a daemon auto-submits it.

The agent is language-agnostic — it edits source and generates diffs while the builder sidecar handles compilation. The sanitizer type (address, memory, undefined) is passed to the agent for context.

```

## Prerequisites

- **[oss-crs](https://github.com/oss-crs/oss-crs)** — the CRS framework (`crs-compose` CLI)
- **[oss-crs-builder](https://github.com/oss-crs/builder)** — builder sidecar that handles compilation and test execution

Set up both by following their respective READMEs before proceeding.

## Quick start

### 1. Configure `crs-compose.yaml`

Copy `oss-crs/example-compose.yaml` and update the paths:

```yaml
atlantis-codex:
  source:
    local_path: /path/to/crs-codex
  cpuset: "2-7"
  memory: "16G"
  llm_budget: 10
  additional_env:
    CRS_AGENT: codex
    CLAUDE_MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

llm_config:
  litellm_config: /path/to/sample-litellm-config.yaml
```

### 2. Configure LiteLLM

Copy `oss-crs/sample-litellm-config.yaml` and set your API credentials. The LiteLLM proxy routes Codex's API calls to the Anthropic API (or your preferred provider). All models in `required_llms` must be configured — Codex uses the primary model for reasoning and may use smaller models (e.g., Haiku) for internal operations.

### 3. Run with oss-crs

```bash
crs-compose up -f crs-compose.yaml
```

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CRS_AGENT` | `codex` | Agent module name (maps to `agents/<name>.py`) |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | Primary Claude model for reasoning |
| `AGENT_TIMEOUT` | `0` (no limit) | Agent timeout in seconds (0 = run until budget exhausted) |

Available models:
- `claude-opus-4-6`
- `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`
- `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`
- `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`

## Patch validity

A patch is submitted only when it meets all criteria:

1. **Builds** — compiles successfully
2. **POVs don't crash** — all POV variants pass
3. **Tests pass** — project test suite passes (or skipped if none exists)
4. **Semantically correct** — fixes the root cause with a minimal patch

## Adding a new agent

1. Copy `agents/template.py` to `agents/my_agent.py`.
2. Implement `setup()` and `run()`.
3. Set `CRS_AGENT=my_agent`.

The agent receives:
- **source_dir** — clean git repo of the target project
- **povs** — list of `(pov_path, crash_log)` tuples (variants of the same bug)
- **harness** — harness name for `run-pov`
- **patches_dir** — write verified `.diff` files here
- **work_dir** — scratch space
- **language** — target language (c, c++, java)
- **sanitizer** — sanitizer type (address, memory, undefined)

The agent has access to three libCRS commands:
- `libCRS apply-patch-build <patch.diff> <response_dir>` — build a patch
- `libCRS run-pov <pov> <response_dir> --harness <h> --build-id <id>` — test against a POV
- `libCRS run-test <response_dir> --build-id <id>` — run the project's test suite
